        <p>
            <em>Bazaar flipping</em> (bz flipping) is one of the fastest,
            most reliable, lowest-risk, and easiest ways to generate money in
            Skyblock. It works by utilizing a method in the game which allows
            you to purchase items from the bazaar and then offer them straight back to
            the bazaar at a <em>higher price</em>. This sounds impossible, but is
            actually exactly how the bazaar is designed.
        </p>
        <h2>Quickstart</h2>
        <p>
            With instant buy and instant sell, the buy price is almost always higher
            than the sell price. This means you can't just insta-buy an inventory
            of diamonds and turn around and insta-sell them for a profit. However,
            using buy orders and sell orders, the buy price is almost always
            <em>lower</em> than the sell price, meaning you <em>can</em> take the
            items you purchased and put them right back onto the market for a profit.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to know why that's possible, read the more detailed section
            at the end of this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin flipping, you need to choose something with a large margin
            and large volume.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Margin</b> is the difference in price between what you paid for
            an item and what you sold it for. As a simple example, if you bought
            a diamond for 100 coins but solid it for 110, your margin would be
            10 coins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Volume</b> is how many items you can buy/sell in a certain
            period of time. If the margin is large, but you can't actually
            buy or sell any items, you won't make any money.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see this data, you'll need to turn on "advaned mode" in the
            bazaar settings by clicking on the bazaar NPC.
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenge is - the bazaar is enormous. Hundreds of different
            types of items whose margin is constantly changing make it
            impossible for a person to find the best flips manually.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, the bazaar data is made freely available to anyone -
            which is how this tool works. The minimum amount of work you
            need to do in order to have this tool give you a list of the best
            flips is to input your budget.
        </p>
        <!--
        <h2>Buy and Sell Orders</h3>
        <p>
            The average Skyblock player, and even the seasoned player in a rush,
            will typically opt for the "insta-sell" or "insta-buy" options from
            the bazaar. Being able to get the items or coins you need instantly
            is very convenient, but it comes at a cost - you're not getting the best
            deal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bazaar itself runs off a system of buy orders and sell orders.
            To simplify, let's only consider sell orders for now. Let's say that
            a player has finished harvesting all their wheat and would like to
            sell their produce for coins. In real life, they would put their items
            up for sale in a market and wait for various customers to purchase
            their goods until everything is sold.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bazaar works much the same way. The farmer will go to the bazaar
            and create a <em>sell order</em>. All the wheat which the farmer
            harvested will instantly be taken from their inventory, but no coins
            will be awarded to them yet. The items were placed on the market, but
            nobody has come around and purchased them yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, another player has the goal of upgrading their wheat minion.
            However, this player is in more of a rush and opts for the instant
            options instead. A few minutes after the farmer puts their wheat on
            the market, this player insta-buys enough wheat to upgrade
            their minion. Finally, at this point, the farmer's wheat is sold and
            they can now collect their coins by visiting the bazaar again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The important take-away from this is that an <em>instant buy</em>
            gets its material from the long list of <em>sell orders</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            What about the other way around? What if the farmer needs to sell
            their wheat quickly, but the player upgrading their minion is
            patient enough to wait for better prices?
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, the player upgrading their minion goes to the
            bazaar and creates a <em>buy order</em>. They tell the bazaar
            how much wheat they need and how much they are willing to pay
            (how much you're willing to pay is usually determined by the
            other offers already on the market) and then instantly, their
            coins are taken from them but they are awarded no wheat yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, only seconds later, the farmer comes along and insta-sells
            their entire inventory of wheat. This goes to the buy order with
            the highest offer - our other hypothetical player's offer. At
            this point, their buy order is filled and they can collect their
            wheat from the bazaar.
        </p>
        <p>
            The take-away here is that a <em>instant sell</em> fulfills
            an existing order in the long list of <em>buy orders</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are no sell orders in the bazaar, you won't be able
            to insta-buy anything - it will just tell you that there's no
            available materials. The same thing will happen if you try
            to sell materials for which there are no buy orders. The bazaar
            does not magically create the things you buy and sell out of
            thin air, they are legitimately offered by other players in the game.
        </p>
        <h2>Where the Flippers Come in to Play</h3>
        <p>
            The logical question is that if most people insta-sell and
            insta-buy, how are there any buy/sell orders at all? Wouldn't
            they be in short supply?
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the role that the flipper plays in the Skyblock economy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flipper <em>always</em> has the time to wait for the best
            deal, because that's what they're after. The flipper is not trying
            to upgrade their minion or sell their wheat, the flipper is trying
            to make money.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, first, a flipper creates a buy order for some item. This makes
            it so a producer of that item - such as a farmer - is able to sell
            their product easily. The flipper waits for a while, and once the
            order is filled, they collect the items from the bazaar. However,
            they do not use these items. Instead, they instantly create a
            sell order and try to sell them all straight back to the bazaar. This
            is what fuels other players' ability to instantly buy materials they
            need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because it's more time consuming and difficult (the difficulty comes
            from the competition in the market) to deal with buy and sell orders,
            there is a reward: flippers typically are able to sell items for a higher
            price than they bought them. This difference ("margin") can be significant,
            especially if applied over many thousands of trades.
        </p>
        <p>
            So there you have it. Instead of being a simple infinite-resources bulk
            shop for players, the bazaar is actually a finely tuned market that
            relies on people who produce goods, people who need goods, and people
            who market the goods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way to think of flippers is as the people who own shops on something
            like a street market. Shop owners neither need the items they buy, nor
            do they actually produce the goods they are selling, but they provide
            an essential service nonetheless - they connect the buyer to the seller, and
            make some margin in-between.
